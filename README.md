## ðŸš€ About The Project

This project aims to digitalize the process of updating product prices in retail stores, saving both time and labor. In many stores today, employees have to manually replace hundreds of price tags during sales or promotional periods. This process not only causes significant time loss but can also lead to errors, such as incorrect prices displayed on shelves.

With the **PriceLink** system, all price updates can be made instantly and remotely through a centralized management panel, making the process faster, more efficient, and error-free.

The smart tag system utilizes e-ink technology, which provides energy efficiency, sustainability, and durability. Overall, this project aims to offer an innovative, eco-friendly, and modern price management solution that addresses the key challenges of the retail industry's digital transformation.
